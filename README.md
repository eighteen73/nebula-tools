# Nebula Tools

This package provides tools for WordPress websites running [Nebula](https://github.com/eighteen73/nebula) and is only suitable for inclusion within that framework. 

At the moment it provides an installation script that is run after project creation to assist with website initial configuration, but it is likely that other useful tools will be added later.
